LDA Topic Modeling and Deep Learning-based Sentiment Classification on IMDB Movie Reviews
## Arunava Kumar Chakraborty


### Introduction:

In this project, I presented an experimental approach to discover the abstract topics using text mining and perform sentiment classification using deep learning framework on IMDB Movie Review dataset. I used the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic modeling to classify movie reviews to a particular topic. Furthermore, I used pretrained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to perform binary-classification on IMDB reviews based on their sentiment polarities.

### Data Description:

Here the description of the database has been presented.

- **review** - IMDB Movie reviews.

- **sentiment** - Sentiment polarity of the reviews (e.g., Positive and Negative).

### Workflow of the Project:

    i. Preprocessing of IMDB Reviews,

        ii. Popular Token Identification,
    
            iii. n-gram Analysis,
            
                 iv. LDA Topic Modeling,
                 
                      v. Sentiment Classification,
                 
                          vi. Sentiment Prediction,
                          
                              vii. Sentiment Prediction on user-end reviews
